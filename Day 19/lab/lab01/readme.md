<h1>Assignment: [Lab] Preferred Language</ h1>

<h3>Build an Express.js application that has two pages:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Home page</li>
  <li>Language Selection Page</li>
</ol>

In the language selection page, the user can enter their name and preferred language from a dropdown (options are: English, French and Spanish). The information is stored in the cookies so the user doesn't have to enter them again.

If the user selects a language and a name then the home page should have an <h1> that greets the user with the selected language. So if the user's name is Tam, here is what the greeting will look like:

<ul>
  <li>English: Hello Tam</li>
  <li>French: Bonjour Tam</li>
  <li>Spanish: Hola Tam</li>
</ul>
If the user didn't select a name and a language, the home page should say: Welcome to My Awesome Website
