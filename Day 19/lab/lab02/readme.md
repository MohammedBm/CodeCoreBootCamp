<h1>Assignment: [Lab] Todo List with cookies storage</h1>

<h3>Build a simple todo list with Express.js that has two pages:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A page to enter a task</li>
  <li>A page to list all tasks</li>
</ul>
The user can visit the first page and should see a form with one input task field: title. The user can hit submit to be redirected to the second page. The second page should list all the tasks entered by that user. Store the tasks in the cookies. Make sure to have navbar to navigate between the two pages.

What limitation do you have by storing the tasks in cookies?
