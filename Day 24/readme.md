`byebug` is a gem that is installed by default rails. You can use it pause execution of any ruby program. In this case, we use pause the server when the `create` action is called. This will pause server itself. Go to your terminal tab when `rails s` was run to access the debugger REPL. Type `exit` to leave byebug.
