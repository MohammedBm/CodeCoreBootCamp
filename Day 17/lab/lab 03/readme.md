<h1>Assignment: [lab] Grade calculator Next Module</h1>

Write a Node.js HTTP server application that takes in a score from the user and then displays a grade on the screen (A, B, C, D or F). For example, the user can enter a URL such as http://localhost:8080/?score=100

The user should then see an <h1> element on the screen with the letter A in it.
