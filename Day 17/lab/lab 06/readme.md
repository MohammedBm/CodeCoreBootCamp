<h1>Assignment: TCP guessing game with Node.js Next Module</h1>

<h2>Write a TCP client and a TCP server in Node.js that does the following:</h2>

<ul>
<li>The client connects to the server</li>
<li>The server generates a random number</li>
<li>The client sends guesses to the server</li>
<li>The server responds to the client after each guess with: "You guessed right in X attempt(s)", "Guess higher" or "Guess lower"</li>
</ul>
What issues would you have if there are multiple clients connecting to the same server? How would you solve that?
