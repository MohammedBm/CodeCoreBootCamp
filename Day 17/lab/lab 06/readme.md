Assignment: TCP guessing game with Node.js Next Module

Write a TCP client and a TCP server in Node.js that does the following:

1. The client connects to the server
2. The server generates a random number
3. The client sends guesses to the server
4. The server responds to the client after each guess with: "You guessed right in X attempt(s)", "Guess higher" or "Guess lower"
What issues would you have if there are multiple clients connecting to the same server? How would you solve that?
