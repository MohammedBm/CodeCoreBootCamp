Assignment: [lab] Largest number in a list Next Module

Write a TCP client and a server application in Node.js:

1. The client should take a string input of comma delimited numbers from the user (e.g. "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9") and send it to the server.
2. The server should respond with the largest number. (e.g. given "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9" responds with 9)
3. The client should print the server response in the console.
