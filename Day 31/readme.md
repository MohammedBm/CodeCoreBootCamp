# Introduction to jQuery - Part 1- Summary Notes
jQuery is used to manipulate and interact with web pages. It makes dealing with them very easy across different browsers. To best understand jQuery we have to learn about the DOM first.

## What is the DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model which is an API for your web page. It's a collection of Javascript objects that represents the HTML document of the current page. DOM objects contain methods for querying and manipulating web pages, and saying what should happen when the user makes certain actions. e.g. "When the user clicks this button, make all the links red."

### What can you do with the DOM?
1. Make changes to the HTML after the page has loaded
2. Respond to a userâ€™s actions (events)
3. Any combination of 1 and 2

## The `window` Object
You have access to the `window` object in every browser. Every interaction we want to do with the browser will happen at the window object. All global functions such as `alert` and `confirm` are properties of the `window` object.

## The `HTML` Document
HTML files look like this:
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script>...</script>
    ...
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <a id='link' href="http://www.google.com">Link</a>
  </body>
</html>
```
The DOM represents the HTML document as a tree of Javascript objects. As we can tell from the above the `HTML` document is structured as a tree so we can represent it in Javascript as a tree of Javascript objects.

Here is an example of interacting with the DOM:
```javascript
for (var i=0; i < document.links.length; i += 1) {
  document.links[i].style.color = "red";
}
```
The example above turns all links to red on a web page. The `document` object is a property of the `window` object.

## Why jQuery
Although we can use plain Javascript to interact with the DOM, we use jQuery for the following reasons:
- DOM made easy
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Overwhelmingly popular

## Primary Usage in jQuery
Most of the time when using jQuery we do the following:
1. Select elements
2. Manipulate selected elements
3. Add event listeners to selected elements

## jQuery Selectors
You can use standard CSS selectors to select elements on the page with jQuery using the `$` function:
- `$('*')`: this selects all the elements on the page
- `$('p')`: this selects all elements that are `p` tags on the page
- `$('.hello')`: this selects all elements with class `hello` on the page
- `$('#special')`: this selects all elements with id `special` on the page
- `$('p .special')`: this selects all elements with class `special` that are has an ancestor with tag `p`
- `$('.hello, .hi')`: this selects all elements with class `hello` or class `hi`

Note that jQuery `$` function returns a `wrapped set` object that we can do many things on like apply a manipulation function, iterate through it and attach event listener.

## jQuery Attributes
We can use the `attr` function in jQuery to get or set specific HTML attributes as in:
```javascript
// Get the value of "src" attribute.
$('img').attr('src');

// Set the value of "src" attribute.
$('img').attr('src', 'http://google.com/logo.png');
```

## jQuery Manipulation
We have many techniques for manipulating elements on the page with jQuery.

### Removing Elements
You can remove elements from the page with jQuery using the `remove` method as in:
```html
<a>One</a>
<a>Two</a>
<img src="three.jpg"/>
<img src="four.jpg"/>
```
then:
```javascript
// Remove all links from the page.
$('a').remove();

// Remove the first image from the page.
$('img').eq(0).remove();
```

### Getting and Setting HTML Attributes
You can get or set HTML attributes using the `html` method as in:
```html
<div class="container">
  Original
</div>
```
then:
```js
// Get the contents of the container.
$('.container').html();

// Update the contents of the container.
$('.container').html('New Content');
```

## Traversal
There are many techniques in jQuery to traverse through page elements once you select elements on the page related in some way to the originally selected element or elements. Here is an example using `children`:
```html
<div id="box">
  <a>a</a>
  <span>b</span>
  <button>c</button>
</ul>
```
then:
```js
// Select all the children of the box
$('#box').children();
```

## Effects
We use effects to easily update or animate elements on the page. Here is an example for using the `hide` method:
```html
<div>
  <span>A</span>
  <a>B</a>
  <img src="c.png"/>
</div>
```
then:
```js
// Hide all links and buttons
$('a, button').hide();
```
Here is another example using the `show` method to show hidden elements:
```html
<div>
  <span>A</span>
  <a>B</a>
  <img src="c.png"/>
</div>
```
then:
```js
// Show links if they are hidden
$('a').show();
```

## Events
The primary idea of events is pre-defining that When X happens, do Y. X is an event and Y is a function.
To add events handlers you can simply using this format:
```js
$(selector).on(event, handlerFunction);
```
For instance:
```html
<span>Click Me</span>
```
then:
```js
// Log when the span is clicked
$('span').on('click', function() {
  console.log('clicked');
});
```
The code above defined an event handler so that when you click on any `span` element the word `clicked` will be logged to the console.

Most common event types are: `click`, `mouseenter` and `mouseleave`.

### Using `this`
You can use `this` in jQuery event handlers to reference the specific element that the event happened on as in:
```
$('tr').on('mouseenter', function () {
  $(this).attr('class', 'highlight');
});
```
The above registers a `mouseenter` event on any `tr` element. However `$(this)` select the specific `tr` that was clicked.


We will dig deeper into some more techniques of using the different aspects of the jQuery library.

## Selectors

### Attribute Selectors
We can select elements using their attributes in different ways for instance:
- `$("[name]")`: selects all the elements that has a `name` attribute
- `$("[name="value"]")`: selects all the elements that have a `name` attribute equals to `value`
- `$("[name!="value"]")`: selects all the elements that have a `name` attribute not equal to `value`
- `$("[name*="value"]")`: selects all the elements that have a `name` attribute than contains the string `value`

### Pseudo Selectors
You can use pseudo selectors to give you more flexibility on selecting elements:
- `$(":first-child")`: selects all the elements that are a first child
- `$(":last-child")`: selects all the elements that are a last child
- `$(":even")`: selects all the even elements zero indexed
- `$(":odd")`: selects all the odd elements zero indexed

## Attributes

### More Methods
Here are some more methods you can use to get or set attributes in jQuery:
- `addClass('hi')`: Adds a class `hi` to the existing set of classes for the selected elements
- `removeClass('hi')`: Remove the class `hi` from the existing set of classes for the selected elements
- `toggleClass('hi')`: Toggles the class `hi` from the existing set of classes for the selected elements. This means that if the class exists it will remove it, if it doesn't exist it will add it.
- `hasClass('hi')`: It will return `true` or `false` whether the selected element has a class `hi`

### jQuery Chaining
You can use chaining of methods in jQuery for the convenience of now having to use multiple lines to call different methods for instance:
```js
// Without chaining
$('a.search').attr('href', 'google.com');
$('a.search').show();

// With chaining
$('a.search').attr('href', 'google.com').show();
```

### Using `val`
You can use `val` method to get or set the values of form fields for instance, if you have:
```js
<input type="text" id="search">
```
You can do
```js
$("#search").val(); // this returns whatever is typed within the text box
$("#search").val("Hello World"); // this sets the content of the text box to `Hello World`
```

## Manipulation

### `append` and `prepend`
You can use `prepend` to add HTML to the beginning of a tag and `append` to add HTML to end of a tag, for instance:
```js
$("body").append("<p>Hi</p>"); // this adds a `p` tag with content `Hi` to the end of the page
$("body").append("<p>Hi</p>"); // this adds a `p` tag with content `Hi` to the start of the page
```

## Traversal

### Using `find`
You can use the `find` method to select all the descendants of a given element filtered by a selector. For instance:
```html
<div id="hey">
  <div><a>Link 1</a></div>
  <a>Link 2</a>
</div>
```
Then if you write with jQuery:
```js
$("#hey").find("a");
```
It will select both `<a>` tags.

### Using `next` and `prev`
You can use `next` to select the sibling immediately following the selected element. You can use `prev` to select the sibling immediately before the selected element.

## Effects
Here are a bunch of other popular effects that you can use with jQuery:
- `toggle` changes the state to hidden if the elements are visible and to visible if they are hidden
- `fadeOut` fades the selected elements out (to a hidden state). You can pass it options such as `slow` and you can give it a call back function as well.
- `fadeIn` fades the element in (to a visible state). You can pass it options and callback functions similar to the `fadeOut` method.
- `slideUp` It does a sliding up motion to an element all the way to a hidden state.
- `slideDown` It does a sliding up motion to an element all the way to a visible state.

## Events

### Shortcut Events
You can use shortcut events for `click`, `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` as they are quite popular instead of using the `on` method as in:
```js
// using "on"
$('a').on('click', function() {
  console.log('clicked');
});

// shortcut method
$('a').click(function() {
  console.log('clicked');
});
```

### Keyboard Events
There are a few keyboard events that you can make use of to respond to users interacting through the keyboard. Here is what you can use:
`keydown`: What the user hits the key down, it gets fired first when the user hit the key
`keypress`: Happens after the keydown event. If you hold the keyboard key, this event will fire multiple times
`keyup`: This event when the user releases the key

To know the key that was pressed, use the `which` method on the `event` object, this gives you a character code. You can translate the character code to a `String` using the `String`'s `fromCharCode` method. Here is an example:
```js
$(document).on('keypress', function(event) {
  // event.which returns the character code of the key pressed.
  var charcode = event.which;
  var key = String.fromCharCode(charcode);
  console.log('key ' + key + ' was pressed');
});
```

## The `submit` Event
If you want to interact with forms on a web page, you can listen to the `submit` event on the form. This is a much better approach than listening to a click on the submit button because forms can be submitted by hitting the enter key. For instance, you can write:
```js
$('form').on('submit', function() {
  console.log('form submitted');
});
```

## Event Bubbling
Events, by default, in Javascript bubble from child elements to their ancestors all the way to the `document` element. For instance if you have:
```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="box"></div>
</div>
```
And you have a click event set for the `.container` and another one set for `.box` then if you click on the `.box` it will trigger the click the event on the `.container`. This won't happen the other way around, clicking on the `.container` won't trigger the event for the `.box`.

### Preventing Events from Bubbling
You can prevent events from bubbling using the `stopPropagation` method on the `event` object as in:
```js
$('.shape').on('click', function(event) {
  console.log('clicked');

  // Don't bubble up this event to the shape's parents.
  event.stopPropagation();
});
```

## Preventing Default Actions
Some HTML elements have a default behaviour. For instance, `<a>` tags will take the user to the site defined by the tag's `href` attribute, `<form>` elements will make an HTTP request to the url defined by the `action` attribute. If you want to prevent the default action you can use `preventDefault` method on the `event` object as in:
```js
$('a').on('click', function(event) {
  console.log('clicked');

  // Don't navigate to the href of this link.
  event.preventDefault();
});
```

## Delegated Events
If you're dynamically adding elements to the page then the new elements won't have possible events attached to them because events are usually attached once the documents loaded (assuming you used the `$(document).ready` technique and not after that. If you want events to be attached to dynamically added elements you can use the delegated events technique by attaching the event to an ancestor element that exists when the document is first loaded. For instance:
```js
$('.container').on('click', '.shape', function() {
  // Works for newly created shapes!
});
```
Because of event bubbling, if you have an element with a class `shape` within `container` and you click on the div with `shape` class within the div with `container` class, the event will bubble from the child div to the parent div and so the function above will get executed.
